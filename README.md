## ReadMe

This is an iOS app to test using Swift to instantiate and run a custom AUAudioUnit V3 tone generator written in Objective C.

The AudioUnit subclass internal uses only  C code to meet (Apple's current) audio real-time requirements.
There is one button to generate a tone,
and one text field to display whether the microphone tap is live.
